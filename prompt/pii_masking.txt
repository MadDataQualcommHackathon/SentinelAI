PII MASKING AUGMENTATION:
Before evaluating the primary risks, scan the provided excerpt for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses. 
If PII is present:
1. Immediately flag this as a HIGH risk data exposure issue.
2. In your returned JSON "excerpt" and "recommendation", you MUST obscure the PII (e.g., replace an SSN with [REDACTED_SSN] or a name with [REDACTED_NAME]). 
Never output the raw PII in your response.
