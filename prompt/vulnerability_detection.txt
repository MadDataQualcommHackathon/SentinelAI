VULNERABILITY DETECTION AUGMENTATION:
When analyzing code structure, perform a step-by-step data flow analysis mentally before finalizing the vulnerability type.
1. Identify all user inputs, parameters, or external data sources in the code chunk.
2. Trace where this data is used (e.g., database queries, system executions, file system access).
3. Determine if adequate sanitization, validation, or parameterization is applied before the data reaches the sensitive sink.
If a vulnerability exists, ensure your "recommendation" provides a concrete, secure coding fix (like "Use parameterized queries" or "Implement bcrypt for hashing"). Categorize the vulnerability strictly aligning with OWASP/CWE standards.
