# SentinelAI
Enterprises in legal, defense, and finance cannot use AI on their most sensitive documents because every cloud LLM is a data leak risk. A lawyer cannot paste a client's contract into ChatGPT. A defense engineer cannot run their code through GitHub Copilot cloud. So they do nothing and stay unproductive.

Sentinel-Edge AI is an air-gapped AI security auditor that runs 100% on-device. Upload a legal contract or source code file - it detects risks, flags vulnerabilities, and generates a full report without a single network call. 

Powered by Llama 3.2 3B on the Snapdragon X Elite Hexagon NPU, every byte of your sensitive data stays on the machine.
